## Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy. It provides an 
object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications using general-purpose
GUI toolkits like Tkinter, wxPython, Qt, or GTK. There is also a procedural "pylab" interface based on a state machine (like OpenGL), 
designed to closely resemble that of MATLAB, though its use is discouraged.[3] SciPy makes use of Matplotlib.

Matplotlib was originally written by John D. Hunter. Since then it has an active development community[4] and is
distributed under a BSD-style license. Michael Droettboom was nominated as matplotlib's lead developer shortly before 
John Hunter's death in August 2012[5] and was further joined by Thomas Caswell.[6][7]

Matplotlib 2.0.x supports Python versions 2.7 through 3.10. Python 3 support started with Matplotlib 1.2.
Matplotlib 1.4 is the last version to support Python 2.6.[8] Matplotlib has pledged not to support Python 2 past 2020 by signing the Python 3 Statement.

## Toolkits

Several toolkits are available which extend Matplotlib functionality. Some are separate downloads, others ship with the Matplotlib source code but have external dependencies.

Basemap: map plotting with various map projections, coastlines, and political boundaries
Cartopy: a mapping library featuring object-oriented map projection definitions, and arbitrary point,
line, polygon and image transformation capabilities. (Matplotlib v1.2 and above)
Excel tools: utilities for exchanging data with Microsoft Excel
GTK tools: interface to the GTK library
Qt interface
Mplot3d: 3-D plots
Natgrid: interface to the natgrid library for gridding irregularly spaced data.
matplotlib2tikz: export to Pgfplots for smooth integration into LaTeX documents
Seaborn: provides an API on top of Matplotlib that offers sane choices for plot style and color defaults, defines simple high-level functions for 
common statistical plot types, and integrates with the functionality provided by Pandas
